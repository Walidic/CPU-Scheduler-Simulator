#  CPU Scheduler Simulator

## Project description
This application simulates different CPU Scheduling algorithms :
- Non-Preemptive Priority Scheduling with context switching (with solution to the starvation problem)
- Non-Preemptive Shortest- Job First (SJF) (with solution to the starvation problem)
- Shortest-Remaining Time First (SRTF) Scheduling with context switching (with solution to the starvation problem)
- AGAT Scheduling (each process have a different quantum)
## Technologies used
- java

## How to Install and Run 
You must install the Java Development Kit (JDK) in order to be able to run the application

## How to Use
1) You enter the number of procesess you want the scheduler to simulate
2) You enter the name of the process
3) You enter the colour (hexadecimal value) of  the process (used for graphical representation) 
4) You enter the arrival time of the process
5) You enter the burst time of the process
6) You enter the priority of the process (Higher priority number means higher priority)
7) You enter the quantum of the process (enter 0 if not AGAT)
8) repeat for all porcesses 
9) Choose type of scheduling you want  to simulate
10) The program calculates the Processes execution order , Waiting Time for each process, Turnaround Time for each process , average waiting time and average turn around time
11) output is reprsented in a graphical format
